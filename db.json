It is about 5.5 inches long - which is about the size of a pen, 2 inches tall and 1 inch high.This being said, it is pretty light and can easily be carried around in your bag but probably would not fit in your pocket.Overall, i think that for many people a battery pack with a single charge might be easier to carry around and do the trick of getting your phone through the entire day... but if you are constantly on the move or need the exrta capacity, this would be a great bet.","rating":"4.0","score":3,"comparative":0.01639344262295082,"effective":0.06557377049180328,"wordLength":5},{"title":"Good Performance","review":"It has been two months that I brought this power bank & I have to say that this powerbank is working very much good. Its very decent looking power bank. I have the black colour variant of it and its very easy to use it. The device comes with 2 USB ports for charging having an output current of 2.1 A and an output voltage of 5 V. Its very hand and easy to use. One intresting feature of the powerbank which i like is that when you plug your device its automatically starts charging the device without you needed to switch it on. It has a decent looking battery indicator . And all of the above this device comes from a well reputed company so its really value for you money. So thumbs up to this power bank and I would suggest you to buy this since its very good in performance but also at the same time its affordable too..","rating":"5.0","score":12,"comparative":0.06857142857142857,"effective":0.34285714285714286,"wordLength":6},{"title":"Build quality is really good at this price point and considering the grand name","review":"Build quality is really good at this price point and considering the grand name. The length of the USB provided is nearly useless. Powerbank takes almost 6 hours to charge up completely. I am quite disappointed when I found out that my mobile (2600mAH) could be charged just thrice and the capacity promised by the power bank is of 10400.","rating":"3.0","score":2,"comparative":0.0273972602739726,"effective":0.0821917808219178,"wordLength":7},{"title":"One thing more i'd like to share with u people dont charge powerbanks with ...","review":"Gud backup approx 9000mah plus,Very light weight product,Only thing is no led flashlight inbuilt, but its a powerbank nt a light utility.So 5star for backup purpose.One thing more i'd like to share with u people dont charge powerbanks with 2amp or 4 amp chargers, use slow chargers theyll give more backups in return👍👍👍","rating":"5.0","score":2,"comparative":0.030303030303030304,"effective":0.15151515151515152,"wordLength":3},{"title":"Short life","review":"Writing review after 11 months of uses.Now after 11 months the backup of this power bank has drastically reduced.
